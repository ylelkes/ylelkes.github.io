  <h1 class="page-title">Political Knowledge- Not worse than other knowledge</h1>
  <p>Democratic rule requires a certain level of political knowledge. 60 years of research indicates we are lacking it. In a <a href="http://paperroom.ipsa.org/app/webroot/papers/paper_25068.pdf">working paper</a>, <a href="http://people.uncw.edu/burnettc/">Crag Burnett</a> and <a href="http://www.mccubbins.us/">Matt McCubbins</a> show people know only slightly more about rules of the road and less about sports, popular culture, geography. Not sure if this is an optimistic story or not.</p>
