Unfortunately, conversations on social media are often toxic and not conducive to healthy political discussions. Twitter, the most widely used social network for political discussions, doubled the limit of characters in a tweet in November 2017, which provided an opportunity to study the effect of technological affordances on political discussions using a discontinuous time series design. Using supervised and unsupervised natural language processing methods, we analyzed 358,242 tweet replies to U.S. politicians from January 2017 to March 2018. We show that doubling the permissible length of a tweet led to less uncivil, more polite, and more constructive discussions online. However, the declining trend in the empathy and respectfulness of these tweets raises concerns about the implications of the changing norms for the quality of political deliberation.","tags":null,"title":"Brevity is the Soul of Twitter: The Constraint Affordance and Political Discussion","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yphtach Lelkes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"b1f79b65b2f56c8288cd51bb0ae873ac","permalink":"/publication/lelkes-2019-k/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T14:53:45.33965Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lelkes-2019-k/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["comparative political communication","content bias","media bias","po","political polarization","selection bias"],"title":"National and Cross-National Perspectives on Political Media Bias","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sean Westwood","Solomon Messing","Yphtach Lelkes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"d9ccadae0f204feef1aa505ba7ae5529","permalink":"/publication/westwood-2018-c/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T14:53:45.413427Z","relpermalink":"/publication/westwood-2018-c/","section":"publication","summary":"Horse race coverage in American elections has shifted focus from late-breaking poll numbers to sophisticated meta analytic forecasts that often emphasize candidates' probability of victory. We place this \"probabilistic horeserace\" in the context of Riker and Ordeshook (1968), and hypothesize that it will lower uncertainty about an election's outcome (perceived potential pivotality), which lowers turnout under the model. After demonstrating the prominence of probabilistic forecasts in election coverage, we use experiments to show that the public has difficulty reasoning about the probability of a candidate's victory. Critically, when one candidate is ahead, win-probabilities convey substantially more confidence that she will win compared to vote share estimates. Even more importantly, we show that these impressions of probabilistic forecasts cause people not to vote in a behavioral game that simulates elections. In the context of the existing literature, the magnitude of these findings suggests that probabilistic horse race coverage can confuse and demobilize the public.","tags":["Electoral Behavior","Political Behavior","Political Psychology","Public Opinion","mypubs"],"title":"Projecting Confidence: How the Probabilistic Horse Race Confuses and Demobilizes the Public","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shanto Iyengar","Yphtach Lelkes","Matthew Levendusky","Neil Malhotra","Sean J Westwood"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"76c41de2a3e0984b9e431d53b67e9958","permalink":"/publication/iyengar-2018/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T14:53:45.459798Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iyengar-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["affective polarization","american","ideology","mypubs","partisanship","social identity"],"title":"The Origins and Consequences of Affective Polarization in the United States","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bert N Bakker","Yphtach Lelkes","Ariel Malka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"705a45b7d63925efe5faf99b3906c230","permalink":"/publication/bakker-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T14:53:45.621581Z","relpermalink":"/publication/bakker-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["mypubs"],"title":"Understanding Partisan Cue Receptivity: Tests of Predictions from the Bounded Rationality and Expressive Utility Perspectives.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yphtach Lelkes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"834bde6cbbc290c8a3fda94a0f778c08","permalink":"/publication/lelkes-2018-n/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T14:53:45.405784Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lelkes-2018-n/","section":"publication","summary":"American partisans are far more hostile towards out-party members than they were 40 years ago. While this phenomenon, often called affective polariza-tion, is well-documented, political scientists disagree on its cause. One group of scholars believes that affective polarization is driven by processes related to social identity theory. In particular, cross-cutting identities have declined in America, and toxic political communication continuously primes partisan identities and resentment. Recently, several scholars have pointed to another phenomenon as the root cause of affective polarization: partisan sorting, i.e. the alignment of par-tisan identities with ideologically consistent issue positions. I review evidence in favor of each claim, and provide additional evidence that affective polarization has increased about as much among those who are not sorted as among those who are sorted. Furthermore, while sorting is only related to affective polarization among the most politically knowledgeable, affective polarization has increased across all levels of political knowledge. Finally, affective polarization may also increase sorting, further complicating any clear cut causal relationship.","tags":["mypubs"],"title":"Affective Polarization and Ideological Sorting : A Reciprocal , Albeit Weak , Relationship Affective Polarization : Identity or Ideology ?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gaurav Sood","Yphtach Lelkes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0faf6ab1e40e1a9688bf7832037bbb26","permalink":"/publication/sood-2016-don/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T14:53:45.673013Z","relpermalink":"/publication/sood-2016-don/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":["mypubs"],"title":"Don't expose yourself: Discretionary exposure to political information","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yphtach Lelkes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"b2a3b55df43d20d70e877e0b400d7d1c","permalink":"/publication/lelkes-2019/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T14:53:45.503765Z","relpermalink":"/publication/lelkes-2019/","section":"publication","summary":"At least two theories have been offered that explain the rise of affective polarization.

This study seeks to arbitrate between these two theories of affective polarization through a survey experiment which asks respondents to rate candidates whose party (or lack thereof) and ideology (or lack thereof) is randomly assigned.

Construct-specific questions were not only as reliable and valid as agree–disagree questions generally, they were also as valid among respondents that were most likely to acquiesce. This suggests two possible outcomes: Either agree–disagree questions do not negatively impact data quality or that construct-specific questions are not a panacea for acquiescence response bias.","tags":["mybib","mypubs"],"title":"Much ado about acquiescence: The relative validity and reliability of construct-specific and agree–disagree questions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ariel Malka","Christopher J.

Analyses with cross-national data from 51 nations reveal that valuing conformity, security, and tradition over self-direction and stimulation (a) predicts ideological self-placement on the political right, but only among people high in political engagement and within relatively developed nations, ideologically constrained nations, and non-Eastern European nations, (b) reliably predicts right-wing cultural attitudes and does so more strongly within developed and ideologically constrained nations, and (c) on average predicts left-wing economic attitudes but does so more weakly among people high in political engagement, within ideologically constrained nations, and within non-Eastern European nations. These findings challenge the prevailing view that needs for security and certainty organically yield a broad right-wing ideology and that exposure to political discourse better equips people to select the broad ideology that is most need satisfying. Rather, these findings suggest that needs for security and certainty generally yield culturally conservative but economically left-wing preferences and that exposure to political discourse generally weakens the latter relation. We consider implications for the interactive influence of personality characteristics and social context on political attitudes and discuss the importance of assessing multiple attitude domains, assessing political engagement, and considering national characteristics when studying the psychological origins of political attitudes.

Whereas \"maximalists\" claim that partisans' views on policies have become more extreme over time (Abramowitz 2010), \"minimalists\" (Fiorina and Abrams 2009) contend that the majority of Americans remain centrist, and that what little centrifugal movement has occurred reflects sorting, i.e., the increased association between partisanship and ideology. We argue in favor of an alternative definition of polarization, based on the classic concept of social distance (Bogardus 1947). Using data from a variety of sources, we demonstrate that both Republicans and Democrats increasingly dislike, even loathe, their opponents. We also find that partisan affect is inconsistently (and perhaps artifactually) founded in policy attitudes. The more plausible account lies in the nature of political campaigns; exposure to messages attacking the out-group reinforces partisans' biased views of their opponents.","tags":["mypubs"],"title":"Affect, not ideology: A social identity perspective on polarization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yphtach Lelkes","Jon A.

But such evidence does not demonstrate that reports gathered under completely anonymous conditions are more accurate. Although complete anonymity may decrease a person's motivation to distort reports in socially desirable directions, complete anonymity may also decrease accountability, thereby decreasing motivation to answer thoughtfully and precisely. Three studies reported in this paper demonstrate that allowing college student participants to answer questions completely anonymously sometimes increased reports of socially undesirable attributes, but consistently reduced reporting accuracy and increased survey satisficing. These studies suggest that complete anonymity may compromise measurement accuracy rather than improve it. © 2012.","tags":["Accountability","Anonymity","Response bias","Satisficing","Social Desirability","mypubs"],"title":"Complete anonymity compromises the accuracy of self-reports","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Lee D.

In a large-scale survey, the relevant views that each group attributed to a contemporary Jesus differed almost as much as their own views. Despite such dissonance-reducing projection, however, conservatives acknowledged the relevant discrepancy with regard to “fellowship” issues (e.g., taxation to reduce economic inequality and treatment of immigrants) and liberals acknowledged the relevant discrepancy with regard to “morality” issues (e.g., abortion and gay marriage). However, conservatives also claimed that a contemporary Jesus would be even more conservative than themselves on the former issues whereas liberals claimed that Jesus would be even more liberal than themselves on the latter issues. Further reducing potential dissonance, liberal and conservative Christians differed markedly in the types of issues they claimed to be more central to their faith. A concluding discussion considers the relationship between individual motivational processes and more social processes that may underlie the present findings, as well as implications for contemporary social and political conflict.","tags":["mypubs"],"title":"How Christians reconcile their personal political views and the teachings of their faith: Projection as a means of dissonance reduction","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ariel Malka","Yphtach Lelkes","Sanjay Srivastava","Adam B.

We evaluate an alternative thesis that the relation between religiosity and political conservatism largely results from engagement with political discourse that indicates that these characteristics go together. In a combined sample of national survey respondents from 1996 to 2008, religiosity was associated with conservative positions on a wide range of attitudes and values among the highly politically engaged, but this association was generally weaker or nonexistent among those less engaged with politics. The specific political characteristics for which this pattern existed varied across ethno-religious groups. These results suggest that whether religiosity trans- lates into political conservatism depends to an important degree on level of engagement with political discourse.","tags":["Conservative ideology","Political attitudes","Political engagement","Religion","Social influence","mypubs"],"title":"The association of religiosity and political conservatism: The role of political engagement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ariel Malka","Yphtach Lelkes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"15226f648c6a5829066e706e04a34be7","permalink":"/publication/malka-2010/","publishdate":"2020-08-05T14:53:45.465779Z","relpermalink":"/publication/malka-2010/","section":"publication","summary":"To many commentators and social scientists, Americans' stances on political issues are to an important extent driven by an underlying conservative–liberal ideological dimension. Self-identification as conservative vs. liberal is regarded as a marker of this dimension. However, past research has not thoroughly distinguished between ideological identity (a self-categorization) and ideology (an integrated value system). This research evaluates the thesis that conservative–liberal identity functions as a readiness to adopt beliefs and attitudes about newly politicized issues that one is told are consistent with the socially prescribed meaning of conservatism–liberalism. In Study 1, conservative–liberal identity, measured in 2000, had an independent prospective effect on support for invading Iraq in 2002 and support for the Iraq war in 2004, controlling for substantive ideology, party identity, and demographics. In Study 2, conservative- and liberal-identifiers adopted stances on farm subsidy policy based on randomly varied cues indicating which ideological group supports which stance. This cue-based influence was mediated by adoption of attitude-supportive beliefs. Discussion addresses the joint impact of political discourse and identity-based social influence on the organization of political attitudes.

This paper uses data from the Associated Press-Yahoo! News-Stanford University survey to explore this possibility, using measures of both explicit racism (symbolic racism) and implicit racism (the Affect Misattribution Procedure). The parameters of multinomial logistic regression equations were estimated to test the hypotheses that racism might have behaved differently on election day than they would have had racism been eliminated. The findings suggest that racism's impact on the election outcome could have been substantial, by causing (1) people who would otherwise have voted for Obama to vote for McCain, for a nonmajor party candidate, or not to vote at all, (2) people who would not have voted to vote for McCain instead, and (3) people who would have voted for a nonmajor party candidate to vote for McCain instead.","tags":["mypubs"],"title":"Determinants of turnout and candidate choice in the 2008 U.S. presidential election: Illuminating the impact of racial prejudice and other considerations","type":"publication"}]
