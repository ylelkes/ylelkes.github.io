[Ari Malka](http://www.yu.edu/faculty/pages/Malka-Ariel) and [Michael Inzlicht](www.michaelinzlicht.com) wrote an [op-ed in the Sunday Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/04/opinion/sunday/the-paradox-of-the-free-market-liberal.html) that discusses some of our [recent work](http://www.michaelinzlicht.com/downloads/Malka-Soto-Inzlicht-Lelkes-2014.pdf), which was published in [JPSP](http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/106/6/1031/).

"Analyzing responses from over 70,000 people from 51 countries, we found that people with a conservative personality did indeed tend to adopt culturally conservative attitudes on matters like abortion, homosexuality and immigration. On this count, the rigidity of the right model seems to be valid.

But when it came to economic matters related to social welfare policy and economic intervention — the central feature of the left-right divide in much of the world — the results were far different. People with a conservative personality tended to lean slightly to the left.""
