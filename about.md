I am a Assistant Professor at the Annenberg School for Communication, University of Pennsylvania.

My main focus is on the role of the political information environment in structuring attitudes, with a special interest in the proliferation of digital media. For instance, I have written on affective polarization, or the increasing hostility between Democrats and Republicans, and ways in which the media has contributed to interparty animosity. Another recent project examines ways in higher quality internet has changed citizen engagement, showing that citizens are learning more about politics, but not necessarily participating because of it. Additionally, I have written extensively on the structure of political ideology and identities. In my research, I rely on a variety of quantitative methods, including survey, field, and natural experiments, as well as survey and geospatial data. 

Before joining the University of Pennsylvania, I was faculty at the Amsterdam School of Communication. I received my Ph.D. from Stanford University. My research has appeared or is forthcoming in various journals across disciplines, including the American Journal of Political Science, PNAS, the Journal of Politics, the British Journal of Political Science, Public Opinion Quarterly, Journal of Experimental Political Science, Political Psychology, the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, and the Journal of Experimental Social Psychology.

I am a faculty affiliate at the Institute for the Study of Citizens and Politics and the Center for Media Risk, and is a fellow at the Amsterdam School of Communication Research. I also hold a secondary appointment in the Penn Political Science department.
